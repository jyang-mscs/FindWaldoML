Find Waldo Project

Introduction:
This class project was done as the final project for the course CompSci 715, an introductory course on machine learning. The idea and goal of the project is to train a deep learning model to be able to successfully find the "Waldo" character from the "Where's Waldo" children book series.

The "final_project_YOLO.ipynb" is created and ran on JupyterLab under Python language.

Requirements to run final_project_YOLO.ipynb:
This assumes you have the following libraries/modules installed:
- torch
- yaml
- shutil

The file path for the directories must be changed accordingly.
The current file path is built off of a MAC root file system.

The directory should be similar to the follow:
dataset_yolo > images > train
dataset_yolo > images > val
dataset_yolo > labels > train
dataset_yolo > labels > val
